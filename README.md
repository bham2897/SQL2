# Stroke Prediction Dataset Management

This repository contains an SQL script tailored for managing a stroke prediction dataset. The script is designed to create a relational database schema that captures essential data for stroke risk analysis. It also demonstrates basic SQL operations including table creation, data insertion, querying with aliases, and view creation to facilitate easier data access and analysis.



## Features

- **Table Creation**: Establishes a table schema suitable for recording patient data linked to stroke risks.
- **Sample Data Insertion**: Provides an example of how to populate the database with initial data.
- **Aliased Queries**: Enhances readability and usability of the query outputs.
- **View Creation**: Facilitates easy access to data subsets of interest, specifically high-risk patients.

## Prerequisites

- PostgreSQL or SQL Server installation.
- Basic understanding of SQL.
- Appropriate database client tools (e.g., pgAdmin for PostgreSQL, SQL Server Management Studio for SQL Server).

## Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/stroke-prediction-sql.git
   cd stroke-prediction-sql
